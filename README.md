# CLOO

cloo comes from clue, cause at the moment, I dont have much of a clue before (getting better now though).
but thinking now, it could also come from cool...

anyway, while developing I noticed that you need to make things like the header (navbar) multiple times in multiple files. I understand now why people love component based tools.
I had another repo with a template, but angular was to complicated for me as a beginner and I had difficult times to understand it. thats why I switched to vanilla html,css and js.
at the moment I save the things in local storage and run it locally but plan to host it somewhere (maby on a raspberry).   

why drinks? its easy to model in blender, its just a tube (cylinder) after all.

I always wanted to make something shop-like.
It's difficult to explain but I'm magicaly drawn to it.

The **GOAL** of this project is to improve my frontend and backend skills.

thanks you [sleepz](https://github.com/sleepz103) for helping me understand the theoretical part better.

other experiences I learned:
- I personally cant work with one single style.css file -> I need multiple
